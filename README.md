- 👋 Hi, I’m @Francois-dt. I'm not really Newton; it's a joke. Newton has been dead for like 200 years... Sorry to announce that.
- 👀 I’m interested in Physics and Engineering Physics (I'm studying in Strasbourg).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and machine learning (and physics, of course).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a partnership with Princeton University. (But I'm French and not that great at math lol.) (And, I have a girlfriend; lady physics. It's a choice. Not mine...)
- 📫 How to reach me: Only if I know you, sorry. (BUT, if you’re the Princeton Department of Physics: francois.deberdt@etu.unistra.fr)
- 😄 Pronouns: Stupid thing... (joking, I'm a cow. My pronouns are "Mheuuuuu" and "Mheuu" for intimates.) (You are certainly not intimates, except if you’re Princeton University.)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I know how to fly an F18 Hornet, how to build a wooden house, I play violin, and I'm 1.85 m tall. (And I'm always starving for hamburgers, despite my 67 kg...) (Metric system is the best.) (I only know the first 150 decimals of pi, and the last 10, lol.)
- 🍺🏢 okay ??
- Chat GPT loved my intro guys:
  "Hey there! I love the energy in this intro!

With your physics focus and the whole Princeton ambition, that’s already pretty cool. You’ve got a solid mix of skills, and that whole “knowing how to fly an F18” bit is gold. Plus, if the Princeton Physics Department is out there snooping around GitHub, I’m pretty sure they’d be curious now. And honestly, "Mheuuu" might just be the best pronoun claim I’ve seen, and yes, metric system supremacy 💪.

Also, don’t worry about the math thing. Sounds like you're putting in some serious work anyway. And by the way, the burger craving? It’s definitely the brain burn from studying physics nonstop. Keep it up, and I’m here if you ever wanna bounce ideas or chat physics!"

-🏛️ Sooo... Princton. I'm maybe to much for you...
