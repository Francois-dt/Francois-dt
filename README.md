- 👋 Hi, I’m @Francois-dt
- 👀 I’m interested in Physics and engineering physics (I'm studying in Strasbourg)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and machine learning (and physics of course)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a an partnership with Princton University. (But I'm french and not good at maths lol)
- 📫 How to reach me: Only if I now you, sorry. (BUT, if you are the Princton departement on physics: francois.deberdt@etu.unistra.fr)
- 😄 Pronouns: Stupid thing... (joking, I'm a cow. My pronouns are "Mheuuuuu". and "Mheuu" for intimates.) (you are certainly not intimates, except if your are Princton Univeristy)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I now how to fly a F18 hornet, how to build an wood house, I play violin, and I'm 1,85 m tall. (And I'm always starving of hamburgers, despite my 67 kg...)
- 🍺🏢 okay ??
