👋 Hi, I’m @Holy-Newton. I’m not actually Newton; it’s a joke. Newton’s been dead for, like, 300 years… Sorry if that’s news to you.

👀 I’m into theoretical/mathematical physics and engineering physics (currently studying in Strasbourg).

🌱 I’m learning Python and machine learning (oh, and physics, obviously).

💞️ I’m down to collaborate on a partnership with Princeton University. (But hey, I’m French and not that great at math, lol.) (Oh, and I’m already taken… by Lady Physics. It’s a choice. Not mine…)

📫 How to reach me: Only if we know each other, sorry. (UNLESS you’re from the Princeton Physics Department: francois.deberdt@etu.unistra.fr)

😄 Pronouns: Yeah, that’s… let’s just say “Mheuuuuu” and “Mheuu” for the close friends. (That’s probably not you. Unless you’re from Princeton.)

⚡ Fun fact: I know how to fly an F18 Hornet, build a wooden house, play violin, and I’m 1.85 m tall. (Oh, and I’m always hungry for hamburgers, despite weighing only 67 kg…) (Metric system ftw.) (And I only know the first 150 decimals of pi… plus the last 10, lol.)

🍺🥸👍 cool??

Oh, and ChatGPT totally loved my intro:

“Hey there! Love the energy in this intro! With the physics focus and Princeton ambition, it’s already super cool. The F18 flying bit? Absolute gold. Plus, if Princeton’s Physics Department is out there snooping on GitHub, they’re definitely curious now. Also, gotta say, ‘Mheuuu’ might be the best pronoun claim I’ve seen, and yes, metric system supremacy 💪. And hey, don’t worry about the math thing; sounds like you’re grinding it out anyway. By the way, the burger craving? Definitely your brain needing fuel from all the physics. Keep going, and I’m here if you ever wanna bounce ideas or chat physics!”

🏛️ So, Princeton… maybe I’m a little too much for you. I might just try Paris Sorbonne University instead!

WOW,this intro is so heavy that time flows slower when you read it…
